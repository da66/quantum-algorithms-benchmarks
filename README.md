# Quantum Computing Finance Benchmarks

Welcome to the quantum computing finance benchmarks.
This repository is made of three sub-modules each reflecting an area where quantum comuting has the potential to improve a computational task.
These modules are Machine Learning, Optimization, and Simulation.

## Vision

This repository is intended to track the progress of quantum computing in a financial setting.
It is made of libraries of community-proposed benchmark problems and solutions to these problems.
Solutions to the benchmark problems may be run on any type of quantum hardware or simulator, e.g., superconducting qubits, annealers, or trapped ions.
The progress of quantum computing towards large problems is tracked by performance metrics defined in each sub-module.
Everybody is welcome to submit benchmark problems that they believe are relevant for quantum computing.

## How to contribute

The proposed solutions to a benchmark problem may either be executed on simulators or hardware.
The platform on which the solution was obtained must be clearly indicated.
Refer to READMEs of the three sub-modules: [Machine Learning](link here), [Optimization](https://github.com/qiskit-community/finance_benchmarks/blob/main/optimization/README.md), and [Simulation](https://github.com/qiskit-community/finance_benchmarks/blob/main/simulation/algorithms/README.md).

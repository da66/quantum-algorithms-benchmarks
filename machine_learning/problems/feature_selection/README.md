# Problem: Feature Selection

Feature selection is a challenging real-world optimization task.
Given training data $X$, the problem is the selection of a subset of relevant
features of $X$ which may then be used to train a predictive model such as fraud detection. 
Optimal feature selection---when formulated in terms of a generic loss function---offers little structure and can, thus,
typically only be approached with heuristics.

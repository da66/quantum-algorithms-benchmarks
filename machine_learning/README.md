# Benchmarking quantum machine learning for finance

This subdirectory holds the machine learning track of the benchmarks of quantum computing algorithms.

## Problem definitions

To benchmark quantum algorithms for [machine learning problems](problems), we consider a variety of benchmarks.
The benchmarks include

* Classification such as fraud detection or customer analysis
* Forecasting
* Feature selection
* etc.

The benchmarks are based on the following quantum algorithms

* [Variational quantum classifier (VQC)](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning/blob/main/qiskit_machine_learning/algorithms/classifiers/vqc.py) 
* [Quantum support vector machine classifier (QSVC)](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning/blob/main/qiskit_machine_learning/algorithms/classifiers/qsvc.py)
* [Neural network classifier](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning/blob/main/qiskit_machine_learning/algorithms/classifiers/neural_network_classifier.py)
* [Black-box binary optimizations (BBBO)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-01-26-909/)
* etc.

## Metrics  

For each of the above mentioned algorithms this repository provides the tools to benchmark these problems with respect to the following metrics.

* **Performance** is measured with respect to standard ML metrics such as accuracy, recall and precision.

* **Resource requirements** is measured considering various aspects: the training time, the inference time of a model, and the amount of data required to train a model up to a pre-defined accuracy.
  For the temporal metrics, it should be noted that this includes the classical pre-processing time it takes to prepares the quantum circuits as well as the execution of the quantum circuits - except for queuing time.
  
* **Intrinsic model properties** This class of metrics includes generalization bounds and capacity measures.

## Datasets

To support comparability, we provide a [set of datasets](datasets) which are relevant for the benchmarking problems given above.
Notably, some of the references below provide links to publicly available online resources and other link to files which generate a benchmarking dataset.


## Benchmark and result summaries

Every benchmark and the respective results are to be summarized in a standardized format including model, backend, training results, etc.
Each sub-folder of [problems](problems) includes templates to summarize the models in *.json* and training parameters as well as final results in *.csv* format.
